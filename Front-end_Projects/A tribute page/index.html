    <p>Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. <br> He attended the University
     of Pretoria<br> before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring <br> citizenship
      through his Canadian-born mother. Two <br>  years later, he matriculated at 
      Queen's University and  <br>  transferred to the University of Pennsylvania
      , where  <br> he received bachelor's degrees in economics and  <br> physics.
       <br><br>

       <h1 class="design" > < 1995 >  </h1>

       He moved to California in 1995 to attend  <br> Stanford University but decided
        to instead pursue  <br> a business career, co-founding the web software  <br> 
        company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal. The startup  <br> was acquired by 
        Compaq for $307 million in 1999. <br>  The same year, Musk co-founded the 
        online <br>  bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000  <br> to form 
        PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5  <br> billion.
        
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="design" > < 2002 >  </h1>

    In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace  <br> manufacturer and space transport 
    services company, <br>  and is its CEO and chief engineer. 
    
    <br><br>
    <h1 class="design" > < 2004 >  </h1>

    In 2004, he was an
     <br>  early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer <br>  Tesla Motors,
      Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its  <br> chairman and product architect,
       eventually assuming <br>  the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, <br>  
       he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company  <br> that was later 
       acquired by Tesla <br>  and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded 
        <br> OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting <br>  friendly artificial
         intelligence. 
         
         <br><br>
         <h1 class="design" > < 2016 >  </h1>


         In 2016, he  <br> co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology
          company <br>  focused on developing brainâ€“computer interfaces, and <br> 
           he founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction  <br> company.
            In 2022, Musk purchased Twitter for <br>  $44 billion. He has proposed 
            a hyperloop high-speed  <br> vactrain transportation system and is the
             president of  <br> the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific 
              <br> research and education.

              <h1 class="design" > < 2018 >  </h1>

    Musk has promoted  <br> contentious perspectives regarding politics and  
    <br> various technologies, especially on Twitter. He has also  <br> been 
    criticized for making unscientific statements, such  <br> as spreading COVID-19
     misinformation. In 2018, the  <br> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
     sued <br>  Musk for tweeting that he had secured funding for a  <br> private takeover of
      Tesla, which the SEC characterized <br>  as false and misleading. He settled with
       the SEC but <br>  did not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down <br> 
        from his
